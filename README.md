## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


 âœ¨ Welcome to my home âœ¨ 

I'm a computational biologist. My interest lies in the use of computational approaches in studying living organism. 
I'm curious about almost everything which explains why I have a weird combination of work experience: yeast metabolism, COVID-19, and pediatric oncology as well as my technical skills: constraint-based modelling, network analysis, and NGS data analysis.  

-  ðŸ”­ ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how epigenomics affect cancer development in children
