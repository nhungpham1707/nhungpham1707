## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


 âœ¨ Welcome to my home âœ¨ 

I'm a computational biologist. My interest lies in the use of computational approaches in studying living organism. 
I have a weird combination of work experience because I'm curious about almost everything.

- Among biology topics, i know a bit more about these than others: yeast metabolism, COVID-19, and pediatric oncology
- Among all the technical skills, i have spent more time with: constraint-based modelling, network analysis, and NGS data analysis.  
-  ðŸ”­ ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how epigenomics affect cancer development in children

- Beside coding, I also like to make figures. Below are my most proud masterpieces
